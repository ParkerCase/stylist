# The Stylist Project: Completion Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Backend
- Created RetailerAPI base classes and interfaces for retailer integration
- Implemented GenericRestAPI for flexible retailer connections
- Added cache implementation for both memory and Redis caching
- Created main.py FastAPI application entry point 
- Implemented API routes for recommendations, retailers, and inventory
- Added style analysis service for personalized recommendations
- Created verification scripts for backend and frontend

### Frontend
- Enhanced virtual try-on with background removal (Remove.bg + TensorFlow.js)
- Added TensorFlow.js model for fallback background removal
- Improved user feedback and recommendation features
- Added client-side caching for performance
- Added verification scripts to ensure correct setup

### Infrastructure
- Updated Docker configuration for production deployment
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Created detailed environment variables documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Tasks

1. Set all required environment variables as documented in `stillremaining.txt`
2. Download TensorFlow.js model files as explained in `public/models/segmentation-model/README.md`
3. Set up Remove.bg API key for production-quality background removal
4. Configure retailer API credentials for real inventory data

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Copy environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp stillremaining.txt .env
   # Edit .env file with your actual API keys
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   npm start

   # Backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. Verify setup:
   ```bash
   ./verify_project.sh
   ```

5. When successful, you should see:
   ```
   PROJECT IS READY FOR TESTING
   ```

## üß™ Testing

Run frontend tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run backend tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## üì± Widget API

The widget API has been extended with new methods:
- `StylistWidget.isOpen()` - Check if widget is open
- `StylistWidget.on()` - Add event listeners
- `StylistWidget.openStyleQuiz()` - Open the style quiz directly
- `StylistWidget.openTryOn()` - Open the virtual try-on directly

## üîå Dependencies

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Zustand, TensorFlow.js
- Backend: FastAPI, Python, Redis (optional)
- External: Remove.bg API, Retailer APIs

## üöÄ Future Improvements

1. Add more retailer integrations (currently supports Generic REST, Shopify, WooCommerce)
2. Enhance background removal precision with improved models
3. Add user authentication and persistent sessions
4. Implement machine learning for style profile improvements
