# Fashion AI Application Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan outlines a comprehensive strategy for validating the Fashion AI application against requirements specified in fashion-ai-specs.md. The plan covers both automated and manual testing approaches, with a focus on end-to-end user experiences.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify all features specified in the Fashion AI specs document
2. Validate user flows and interactions
3. Test integrations with retailer-specific inventory
4. Ensure responsive design and cross-browser compatibility
5. Verify performance metrics

## Test Environment

### Browsers
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

### Devices
- Desktop (various resolutions)
- Tablet (iPad, Android tablets)
- Mobile (iPhone, Android phones)

### Test Users
- New users (first-time experience)
- Returning users with existing preferences
- Users with items in closet
- Users with empty closet

## Test Types

### Automated E2E Tests
- Cypress tests for core functionality
- Component tests for UI elements
- API integration tests
- Performance tests

### Manual Tests
- Usability testing
- Visual inspection
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility testing

## Test Data

### Required Fixtures
- Mock retailer inventory (JSON)
- User profile data
- Sample closet items
- Test images for upload
- Celebrity fashion data

## Test Execution Strategy

### CI/CD Integration
- Run all E2E tests on pull requests
- Daily regression test runs
- Weekly full test suite runs

### Test Prioritization
1. **Critical Path Tests**: Authentication, core widget functionality
2. **Feature Tests**: All individual features
3. **Integration Tests**: Feature interactions
4. **Edge Cases**: Error states, boundary conditions

## Success Metrics

- 100% test coverage of requirements
- All critical paths have automated tests
- Performance tests meet timing standards:
  - Widget loads in < 3 seconds
  - Suggestions generated in < 5 seconds
- Zero high-priority bugs in production

## Reporting

- Test results published to dashboard
- Bug tracking in issue system
- Weekly test status report
