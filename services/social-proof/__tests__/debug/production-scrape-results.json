I'd be lying if I said that flipping through their outfits all the time didn't influence the way that I dress or the fashion items I end up adding to my cart. My outfits do, in fact, mirror celeb looks from time to time, and my digital shopping cart definitely has some affordable lookalikes to the exact items girls like Kaia, Gigi, Emily, Bella, and co. are sporting.",
