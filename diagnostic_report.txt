Issues Detected:
Issue 1: Suspense Fallback Stuck
Description: One or more Suspense fallbacks got stuck and never resolved
Recommendation: Check lazy-loaded components, ensure they are importing correctly

Issue 2: AsyncComponentLoader Timeout
Description: AsyncComponentLoader timed out waiting for component to load
Recommendation: Check for unresolved promises in the lazy-loaded components

Issue 3: Error Boundary Triggered
Description: An error boundary was triggered during rendering
Recommendation: Check the component stack in the logs for the source of the error

Issue 4: Background Initialization Missing
Description: Background initialization tasks did not complete
Recommendation: Check for errors in the background initialization tasks
