# Lazy Loading Debug Report

## Issue Identified
The Stylist Widget is getting stuck on a Suspense fallback screen due to unresolved dynamic imports. The root cause appears to be:

1. The `AsyncComponentLoader` component includes a timeout, but lacks proper exception handling for failed lazy imports
2. React Suspense boundaries might get stuck in "pending" state if any errors occur during lazy loading
3. Missing error boundaries around React.lazy imports
4. The timeout mechanism in AsyncComponentLoader does not properly resolve Suspense when triggered

## Solution Approach
The fix involves enhancing the AsyncComponentLoader with proper error handling and a more robust timeout mechanism that can definitively resolve the Suspense state:

1. Implement error boundaries around lazy-loaded components
2. Add a more reliable timeout mechanism that forcibly bypasses the Suspense state
3. Add state tracking to detect and resolve "stuck" suspense states
4. Ensure all lazy imports have proper catch handlers

This approach maintains all functionality while preventing the widget from hanging indefinitely.
