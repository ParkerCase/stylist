# FashionAI System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the FashionAI system features.

## 1. AI Chat with Claude via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

### Files Modified:
- `src/utils/environment.ts` - Created to centralize environment variable access with TypeScript types
- `src/services/chatService.ts` - Enhanced with direct Claude API integration
- `webpack.config.js` - Updated to properly pass environment variables to frontend

### Key Changes:
- Added direct Claude API integration with proper error handling
- Implemented fallback mechanism to backend proxy when API keys are not available
- Centralized environment configuration with proper defaults
- Enhanced chat context handling for better conversation flow

### Usage:
The AI Chat now connects to Claude API using the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. The system will:
1. Attempt to use the Claude API directly from the frontend when the API key is available
2. Fall back to backend proxy if direct connection fails
3. Fall back to rule-based responses if no Claude access is available

## 2. Recommendation Engine Connection

### Files Modified:
- `src/api/recommendationApi.ts` - Connected to recommendation_service.py
- `src/services/chatService.ts` - Enhanced recommendation integration

### Key Changes:
- Connected frontend recommendation UI components to the backend recommendation service
- Created proper TypeScript interfaces for recommendation data models
- Implemented recommendation retrieval with proper error handling
- Added user context to recommendations for personalization

### Usage:
The recommendation engine now:
1. Retrieves personalized recommendations based on user profile
2. Supports recommendations with specific context (e.g., "show me casual tops")
3. Includes outfit recommendations and match reasons
4. Gracefully handles errors with sensible defaults

## 3. Retailer Integration for Shopify and WooCommerce

### Files Modified:
- `integrations/retailers/shopify.py` - Enhanced with real API implementation
- `integrations/retailers/woocommerce.py` - Enhanced with real API implementation
- `config.py` - Added proper environment variable configuration

### Key Changes:
- Enhanced retailer implementations to use credentials from environment variables
- Implemented proper credential validation and fallback to mock data
- Created robust error handling for API failures
- Added caching for better performance and reduced API calls

### Usage:
The retailer integration now:
1. Automatically activates when real API credentials are present in environment variables
2. Falls back to mock retailer data when `USE_MOCK_RETAILER=true` or credentials are invalid
3. Provides a consistent API interface regardless of the data source
4. Handles connection issues gracefully

## 4. Enhanced Virtual Try-On

### Files Modified:
- `src/services/background-removal/tfBackgroundRemoval.ts` - Created for TensorFlow-based background removal
- `src/services/background-removal/removeBackgroundApi.ts` - Created for Remove.bg API integration
- `src/services/background-removal/utils.ts` - Enhanced to support both methods
- `src/hooks/useBackgroundRemoval.ts` - Updated to handle both removal methods

### Key Changes:
- Added TensorFlow BodyPix integration for body segmentation and measurement
- Integrated Remove.bg API with proper API key handling
- Created smart fallback between the two methods
- Added basic body measurement and sizing logic
- Enhanced image processing for better garment overlay

### Usage:
The virtual try-on now:
1. Attempts to use Remove.bg API when API key is available
2. Falls back to TensorFlow BodyPix when API is unavailable
3. Extracts approximate body measurements for better garment sizing
4. Provides realistic garment overlay with proper positioning

## 5. Configuration System

### Files Modified:
- `.env.example` - Created template for environment variables
- `webpack.config.js` - Enhanced to properly pass environment variables
- `src/utils/environment.ts` - Created for frontend environment variable access
- `config.py` - Already had backend environment variable configuration

### Key Changes:
- Centralized all environment variables in .env file
- Created proper TypeScript access to environment variables
- Added sensible defaults for all configuration values
- Enhanced webpack configuration to properly expose variables to frontend

### Usage:
The configuration system now:
1. Reads variables from .env file with proper defaults
2. Exposes environment variables to both frontend and backend
3. Handles edge cases like missing variables gracefully
4. Provides type-safe access to configuration values

## Summary

These changes complete the four required features:
1. AI Chat now properly connects to Claude via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
2. Recommendation Engine links frontend UI to recommendation_service.py
3. Retailer Integration for Shopify and WooCommerce activates when credentials are present
4. Virtual Try-On is enhanced with body-aware segmentation and sizing

The FashionAI system is now ready for demonstration with all core features implemented.
