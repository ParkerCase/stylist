# Social Proof Integration System

This document outlines the implementation of the social proof system in Stylist, which allows fashion recommendations to be influenced by celebrity outfits and styles.

## Overview

The social proof system consists of several components:

1. **Data Collection**: Scraping celebrity outfit data from fashion websites (like WhoWhatWear)
2. **Text Processing**: Extracting meaningful fashion elements from outfit descriptions
3. **Social Proof Context**: Structuring celebrity outfit data for the recommendation engine
4. **Recommendation Integration**: Using celebrity outfit data to influence item and outfit recommendations
5. **UI Integration**: Displaying "Inspired by [Celebrity]" attribution in the Lookbook

## Architecture

### Data Flow

```
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
| WhoWhatWear    | ---> | Outfit Parser  | ---> | Social Proof   |
| Scraper        |      | & Extractor    |      | Context        |
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
                                                       |
                                                       v
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
| UI Display     | <--- | API Response   | <--- | Recommendation |
| (Lookbook)     |      | Serialization  |      | Engine         |
+----------------+      +----------------+      +----------------+
```

## Components

### 1. Scraper (`whoWhatWearScraper.ts`)

The scraper collects celebrity outfit data from WhoWhatWear using Puppeteer.

**Features:**
- Multiple extraction strategies for different page formats
- Robust fallback mechanisms to handle failures
- Confidence scoring for celebrity identification
- Mock data generation for testing

### 2. Outfit Parser (`parseWhoWhatWear.ts`)

Processes outfit descriptions to extract fashion elements.

**Features:**
- Enhanced celebrity name extraction with confidence scoring
- Comprehensive fashion vocabulary for element extraction
- Garment type identification
- Color, pattern, and style extraction
- Protection against false positives

### 3. Social Proof Context (`SocialProofContext` class)

Structure for representing celebrity outfit data in the recommendation engine.

**Attributes:**
- `celebrity`: Name of the celebrity
- `event`: Optional event context (e.g., "Met Gala", "Movie Premiere")
- `outfit_description`: Full text description of the outfit
- `outfit_tags`: List of garment/item types
- `patterns`: List of patterns
- `colors`: List of colors

### 4. Recommendation Integration

#### Enhanced Match Calculation (`calculate_social_proof_match` method)

The recommendation service calculates how well an item matches a celebrity outfit based on:

1. **Garment Match** (30%)
   - Direct matches (e.g., blazer to blazer)
   - Category matches (e.g., any footwear to shoes)
   - Related matches (e.g., pumps to heels)

2. **Color Match** (25%)
   - Direct matches (e.g., black to black)
   - Similar color matches (e.g., navy to blue)
   - Neutral color fallbacks

3. **Pattern Match** (15%)
   - Direct matches (e.g., floral to floral)
   - Pattern category matches (e.g., leopard to animal print)
   - Solid pattern fallbacks

4. **Silhouette Match** (15%)
   - Direct fit matches (e.g., oversized to oversized)
   - Complementary fit groups

5. **Style Match** (15%)
   - Direct style matches (e.g., minimalist to minimalist)
   - Style category matches (e.g., casual to relaxed)

The system is designed to handle partial matches with weighted components, allowing for recommendations even when exact matches aren't available.

## Match Weighting and Threshold

- **Match Threshold:** 0.4 (lowered from 0.5 to accommodate partial matches)
- **Weight Distribution:** Garment (30%), Color (25%), Pattern (15%), Silhouette (15%), Style (15%)

This configuration balances the importance of what the item is (garment type) with how it looks (color, pattern, fit, style).

## Implementation in Recommendation Flow

1. **Item Recommendations:**
   - Each item is scored against the user's style profile
   - If social proof context is provided, additional social_proof_match score is calculated
   - Items with good social proof match include "[Celebrity name]'s style" in match reasons
   - Social proof attributes are added to items for display in the UI

2. **Outfit Recommendations:**
   - Outfits can be influenced by social proof context
   - Items with good social proof match are more likely to be included
   - Outfit match reasons include "Inspired by [Celebrity]" if applicable
   - Social proof context is stored with the outfit for API responses

## API Integration

The API responses include social proof attributes for both items and outfits:

**Item Example:**
```json
{
  "item_id": "store1_blazer1",
  "score": 0.85,
  "match_reasons": ["Matches your minimalist style", "Inspired by Zendaya's style"],
  "social_proof_match": {
    "celebrity": "Zendaya",
    "match_score": 0.78,
    "event": "Movie Premiere"
  }
}
```

**Outfit Example:**
```json
{
  "outfit_id": "outfit_12345",
  "items": ["store1_blazer1", "store1_shirt1", "store1_pants1"],
  "score": 0.82,
  "match_reasons": ["Inspired by Zendaya's look", "Complete outfit for evening"],
  "social_proof": {
    "celebrity": "Zendaya",
    "event": "Movie Premiere",
    "outfit_description": "..."
  }
}
```

## UI Integration (Lookbook Component)

The Lookbook component displays social proof information for recommended items and outfits:

1. Items influenced by celebrity style display "Inspired by [Celebrity]" in their match reasons
2. Outfits influenced by celebrity style include attribution
3. Trending tab includes a dedicated "Celebrity Inspiration" section
4. Users can click on celebrity outfits to open the SocialProofModal

## Testing

The integration includes comprehensive tests:

1. `test_socialproof_integration.py`: Basic tests for social proof matching
2. `test_social_proof_complete_pipeline.py`: End-to-end tests from parsing to recommendation
3. `run_social_proof_test.py`: Script to run tests and generate detailed reports

Tests validate:
- Outfit element extraction from descriptions
- Partial matching capabilities
- Influence on recommendations
- API serialization

## Helper Utilities

The `social_proof_utils.py` module provides utilities for:
- Loading and saving social proof data
- Creating SocialProofContext objects from scraper data
- Filtering social proof items based on quality criteria
- Generating reports on social proof data

## Future Improvements

1. **Expanded Fashion Vocabulary**: Add more garment types, styles, and patterns
2. **Improved Matching Algorithm**: Enhance the partial matching with machine learning
3. **Visual Similarity**: Add image-based similarity for matching
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Allow users to rate celebrity-inspired recommendations
5. **Trend Analysis**: Identify trending celebrity styles over time

## Conclusion

The social proof integration system enhances the recommendation experience by incorporating celebrity style influences. The system is designed to handle partial matches gracefully, ensuring users receive relevant recommendations even when exact matches aren't available. The integration includes comprehensive testing and utilities to ensure reliable operation.
