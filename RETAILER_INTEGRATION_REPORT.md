# âœ… Retailer Integration Report

## Overview

The Stylist application includes a robust and extensible retailer integration layer that connects to various e-commerce platforms. The integration architecture is designed to be:

1. **Flexible** - Support for multiple retailer APIs through a common interface
2. **Resilient** - Graceful fallback to mock data when credentials are unavailable
3. **Extensible** - Easy to add new retailer integrations
4. **Demo-ready** - Fully functional with mock data for demonstration purposes

## Integration Architecture

The retailer integration layer follows a layered architecture:

1. **Base Interface** (`RetailerAPI`)
   - Abstract base class defining the common API interface
   - Handles caching, HTTP requests, error handling, and retries
   - Provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods

2. **Retailer-Specific Implementations**
   - `ShopifyAPI` - Integration with Shopify stores
   - `WooCommerceAPI` - Integration with WooCommerce stores
   - `GenericRestAPI` - Configurable client for standard RESTful APIs
   - `MockRetailerAPI` - Mock implementation for testing and demos

3. **Fallback Mechanism**
   - Both Shopify and WooCommerce integrations include fallback to mock data
   - Transparent logging of fallback mode
   - Environment variable control (`USE_MOCK_RETAILER=true|false`)

## Mock Retailer Implementation

The mock retailer API provides a realistic simulation of retailer API behavior:

- **Generated mock inventory** with varied products across multiple categories
- **Realistic product attributes** including prices, brands, colors, sizes, etc.
- **Support for all core API operations**:
  - Inventory retrieval with pagination and filtering
  - Item detail lookup
  - Search functionality
  - Availability checking
- **Cache support** for improved performance in demo mode

### Sample Data

The mock retailer provides 100 sample items across multiple categories including tops, bottoms, shoes, dresses, outerwear, and accessories. Each item has realistic attributes such as:

- Multiple product categories and subcategories
- Various brands, colors, and sizes
- Detailed style tags and occasion tags
- Realistic pricing and discounts
- Multiple product images

## Platform-Specific Implementations

### Shopify Integration

- **Full Shopify API support** when credentials are available
- **Transparent fallback** to mock data when credentials are missing
- **Credential validation** to determine whether to use real or mock data
- **Environment variable override** (`USE_MOCK_RETAILER=true`) forces mock mode

### WooCommerce Integration

- **Complete WooCommerce REST API support** when credentials are available
- **Seamless fallback** to mock data when credentials are missing
- **Credential validation** to determine operation mode
- **Environment variable override** capability

### Generic REST API

- **Configurable field mapping** to adapt to various API formats
- **Customizable endpoints** for different API operations
- **Flexible response parsing** with support for nested data

## Configuration Management

- **Retailer configurations** managed through proper API routes
- **Validation** of configuration through JSON schema
- **Caching** with Redis (primary) and memory (fallback) options
- **Security** measures for credential handling

## Fallback Mode

The retailer integrations include a sophisticated fallback mode:

1. **Automatic detection** of missing or invalid credentials
2. **Internal creation** of a mock retailer instance
3. **Transparent proxying** of all API calls to the mock instance
4. **Preserving retailer identity** in returned data
5. **Detailed logging** of fallback operations

## Environment Configuration

The following environment variables control retailer integration behavior:

- `USE_MOCK_RETAILER=true|false` - Force usage of mock data
- `STYLIST_DEBUG=true|false` - Enable detailed debug logging
- `STYLIST_API_KEY` - API authentication key
- Additional retailer-specific credentials (documented in `STILL_MISSING.md`)

## Integration with Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine successfully integrates with the retailer API layer to generate personalized recommendations based on the available inventory. The recommendation system interfaces with the retailer API to:

1. Fetch available inventory across product categories
2. Filter items based on user preferences
3. Calculate match scores between user profiles and products
4. Assemble complete outfits from complementary pieces
5. Check product availability before recommending items

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with live APIs** when credentials become available
2. **Add more retailer platforms** as needed
3. **Implement inventory synchronization** for real-time updates
4. **Add product variant handling** for complex product structures
